Hello world tutorial for github

Now we are making edits inside a different branch. I wonder
if in real world people first upload their edit branch to github
to get it code reviewed and only after that merge with the master.

something like 
git branch nikola-featureX
...make some edits...
git push origin nikola-featureX
