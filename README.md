Hello world tutorial for github

Now we are making edits inside a different branch. I wonder
if in real world people first upload their edit branch to github
to get it code reviewed and only after that merge with the master.

something like 
git branch nikola-featureX
...make some edits...
git push origin nikola-featureX

Making first remote change.
git commit -a
git push origin master (after entering usename/password)
merged the changes with the master verstion in github.

git branch
git branch review
git checkout review
git branch # shows that i am working inside review branch).
So now if i commit changes and push to github, i should be able to 
do a review of the changes before merging.
